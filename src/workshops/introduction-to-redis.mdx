This session will serve as a practical introduction to Redis, a common distributed in-memory data store. By the end of the session, students will be able to answer questions like:

- What is Redis?
- How can I explain what it does to my non-technical manager / PM in a way they'll understand?
- What kinds of problems does Redis solve?
- What shouldn't you use Redis for?
- How should I deploy Redis in my environment?

We'll also go through a couple of case studies that concretely demonstrate common problems solved by Redis.
