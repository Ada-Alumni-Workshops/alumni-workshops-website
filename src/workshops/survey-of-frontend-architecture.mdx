_Duration: 1 hour_

In this session, you’ll find a high-level introduction to frontend architecture patterns, learning what approach to take given a set of requirements. We’ll start by exploring approaches to simple, static sites and gradually increase design complexity as we introduce new product and process requirements.

By the end of the lecture, I hope you’ll walk away with an understanding of when and why to apply common frontend architecture patterns.
