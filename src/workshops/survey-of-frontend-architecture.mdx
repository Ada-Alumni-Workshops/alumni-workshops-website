# Survey of Frontend Architectures

## 2022-03-23 at 6:30pm

_Duration: 1 hour_

In this session, you'll find a high-level introduction to frontend architecture patterns, learning what they are and when to apply them. We'll start by exploring approaches to simple, static sites and gradually increase design complexity as we introduce new product and process requirements. By the end of the session, students will be able to:

- Gather relevant product and organizational requirements
- Understand the purpose of various modern frontend web technologies such as static site generators, state management, web workers, server-side rendering, micro-frontend architectures, and more.
- Map requirements to technologies that solve for those specific use cases.

This session will combine technology overviews and case studies to give students a deeper understanding of the patterns discussed.
