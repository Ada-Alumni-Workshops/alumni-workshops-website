# Part 1: Advanced Object Oriented Design Patterns

## 2022-05-12 5:00pm

_Duration: 2 hours_

In this latest addition to the Patterns in Programming workshop series, we'll focus on design patterns, with a focus on object-oriented design. We'll dive into a set of common and useful design patterns outlined in the famous book, Design Patterns, by the Gang of Four (Gamma et al.), which also serve as shorthand terms that engineers use to name and describe their code. Using some example code projects, you'll gain an understanding of when to use (and NOT to use) these patterns, so you can make your code more communicative and extensible.

Using these patterns as a base, weâ€™ll also discuss how some of these ideas apply more broadly when thinking about distributed system design.

### This is part 1 of a 2-part workshop (see [Part 2](/workshops/part-2-advanced-object-oriented-design-patterns))

He has built software and supported people for nearly 15 years, at places like Microsoft, Ookla, and Remitly. He currently manages platform teams at Indeed. He enjoys music, games, and exploring the Seattle food scene with his family.

Unfortunately, he cannot turn off the dad jokes.
