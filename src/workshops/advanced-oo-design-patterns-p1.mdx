title: Part 1 Advanced Object Oriented Design Patterns
description: In this latest addition to the Patterns in Programming workshop series, we'll focus on design patterns, with a focus on object-oriented design. We'll dive into a set of common and useful design patterns outlined in the famous book, Design Patterns, by the Gang of Four (Gamma et al.), which also serve as shorthand terms that engineers use to name and describe their code. This is a 2-part workshop!

In this latest addition to the Patterns in Programming workshop series, we'll focus on design patterns, with a focus on object-oriented design. We'll dive into a set of common and useful design patterns outlined in the famous book, Design Patterns, by the Gang of Four (Gamma et al.), which also serve as shorthand terms that engineers use to name and describe their code. Using some example code projects, you'll gain an understanding of when to use (and NOT to use) these patterns, so you can make your code more communicative and extensible.

Using these patterns as a base, weâ€™ll also discuss how some of these ideas apply more broadly when thinking about distributed system design.

### This is part 1 of a 2-part workshop (see [Part 2](/advanced-oo-design-patterns-p2))
