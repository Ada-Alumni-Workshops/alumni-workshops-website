Hands-on experience with hosted ML Platforms. Starts with local development with Python's scikit-learn library and Jupyter notebooks, and a cursory overview of concepts in machine learning. The second-half moves the development cycle over to Amazon SageMaker, an ML Platform, which many companies use to productionize ML pipelines. Covers an overview of the ML model lifecycle.

I spent six years working on Amazon SageMaker in many different capacities. I work at a different company now.
