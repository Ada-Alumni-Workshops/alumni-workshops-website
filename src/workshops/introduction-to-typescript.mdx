This introductory workshop will get you started writing TypeScript code. You will see the advantages to using static typing to shorten the development cycle, spotting errors earlier in the process.

We will:

- Walk through setting up the Typescript development environment with VS Code
- Examine the advantages of using static typing
- Use Typescript's classes
- Extend Typescript classes & interfaces
- Convert a sample Express project to Typescript
- Write an NPM Module with Typescript

The workshop will be very much hands-on with students writing and editing code. The goal is to position students to be able to continue learning TypeScript independently.
