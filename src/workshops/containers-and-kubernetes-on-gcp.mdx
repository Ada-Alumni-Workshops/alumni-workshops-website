# An Illustrated & Hands-On Intro to Containers and Kubernetes on Google Cloud

## TBD

Since 2014, adoption of container technology and Kubernetes has quickly spread across large and small businesses alike. The pervasiveness and flexibility of these tools has made a strong understanding of containers and Kubernetes essential in any technical practitioner’s toolbox. This workshop will go over what containers are and why they matter to you as a technologist/developer, and to companies as a key part of running their businesses.

Kubernetes contributor, CNCF Ambassador, and Google Cloud Developer Advocate Kaslin Fields will go over the uses of containers as a packaging and isolation mechanism for applications, and how Kubernetes enables use of containers at the scale needed to run a business. All using a fun, illustrated cookie analogy! Beyond discussing the basics, you’ll get hands-on with running applications in containers on Kubernetes using Google Cloud.
