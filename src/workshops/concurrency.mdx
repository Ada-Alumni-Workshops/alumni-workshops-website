# Concurrency

## 2022-04-30 10:30am

_Duration: 4 hours_

In this _4-hour_ workshop, we will explore the concepts of concurrency and multithreaded programming, and common patterns that we apply. Using some example code projects, we will learn how to make our code multithreaded in order to _safely_ speed up our programs. We’ll also discover commonly encountered programming problems, and apply standard patterns to solve them.

Using these patterns as a base, we’ll also discuss how some of these ideas apply when thinking about distributed system design.

_There will be breaks, including a lunch break, during this workshop._
