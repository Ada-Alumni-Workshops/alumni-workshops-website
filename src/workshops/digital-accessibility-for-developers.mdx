# Digital Accessibility for Developers

## 2022-05-27 at 5:45pm

_Duration: 1 hour_

**Topics:** Disabilities and Standards, HTML5 as A11y, Images, Design and Color, Multimedia and Motion, Forms, Using ARIA

Students will gain an introduction to Digital Accessibility, disability in the digital context, and the WCAG standards that govern what is and what is not considered accessible code.

We will then go deeper and ask, “How do we as developers make products with accessibility in mind?” We’ll cover a number of topics including HTML5, Images, Forms and more. We’ll talk high level, with examples, then dive into the code.

We’ll conclude with resources for how developers can specialize in this growing and rewarding Software Engineering niche.
