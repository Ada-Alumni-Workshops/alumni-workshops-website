This presentation will be about the mechanics of buying a home. It will cover the steps in the process, the pitfalls to avoid and the knowledge needed to make a good decision that will result in a home that your family can enjoy for years.

The areas covered will be:

- The timeline will be clearly explained from selecting a Realtor, to finding the right home, making an offer, inspecting the home, communicating with lenders and escrow and finally, getting keys
- How to choose a lender, compare rates and understand things like "buying points" and the various fees that lender's charge.
- What to expect in this particular market and strategies to deal with some of the imbalances that we currently have in the Puget Sound Region.

I expect that there will be questions and am looking forward to them.

I have been a Realtor for almost a decade and have a strong construction background. Out of 230 agents at my firm I am consistently among the top 5 agents in terms of production and have helped countless hundreds of clients realize their dream of being a homeowner.
