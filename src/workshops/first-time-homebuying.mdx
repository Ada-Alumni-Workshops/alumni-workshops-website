This presentation will be about the various steps involved in buying a home. It will cover the steps in the process, the pitfalls to avoid and the knowledge needed to make a good decision that will result in a home that your family can enjoy for years. The areas covered will be:

- The timeline will be clearly explained from selecting a Realtor, to finding the right home, inspecting the home, developing a strategy for making an offer, communicating with lenders and escrow and finally, getting keys
- The types of homes that are available will be discussed along with neighborhood infrastructure and the things to evaluate during an inspection
- An overview of the market (both national and regional) will be discussed which will include the factors that affect the timing of a good home purchase and interest rate fluctuations.
- How to choose a lender, compare rates and understand things like "buying points" and the various fees that lender's charge.
- What to expect in this particular market and strategies to deal with some of the imbalances that we currently have in the Puget Sound Region.

I expect that there will be questions and am looking forward to them.

I've been a Realtor for about a decade. I worked in the construction industry for about ten years before I went to Portland State University where I graduated with a bachelor of science in history along with two years of studying statistical analysis.

Following graduation, my wife and I started buying homes and fixing them up for resale. We had rewarding relationships with real estate agents during this time but I realized that with my unique background in construction and analysis I was well suited for a career as a real estate agent. After moving to the Seattle area in 2012 I made the shift to being a real estate agent. It's been a rewarding career change that has enabled me to help hundreds of clients realize their dream of becoming a homeowner.
